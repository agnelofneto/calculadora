### ðŸ’» CALCULATOR

I have created a calculator that allows the user to perform mathematical calculations that can perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
What was developed:


- Logic and Algorithms with Javascript;
- Mobile version and responsiveness;
- DOM manipulation;
- Function return;
- Work with colors and fonts;
- Align and position text and elements;
- Application of spacing;
- Use CSS variables to manipulate the color palette and font size of the project;
- Structure of the project's file system separated by folder;
